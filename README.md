Logs sugar log data into a txt file - utilizes GUI to input data

Problem Statement: Family member of mine had lost one of their tools needed to automatically input the data from their sugar log into the computer. Family member is not the most technical of people and would take quite a while having to write all of the data from their tracker into the computer.

Solution: This program was made to help my family member log their levels much easier by utilizing an easy to read GUI with simple controls. Data is then put into a txt file that is simple enough for them to read and understand
and also send to their doctors if needed. 

This is for those that lack the automatic upload of their log and have to manually enter the data from it. It makes the manual process much easier and more automated
